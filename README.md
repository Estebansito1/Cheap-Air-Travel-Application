## Introduction: 
Our project aims to develop an Airline Management System using Java and Eclipse. This system will offer a comprehensive solution for managing various aspects of an airline's operations, including flight destination, passenger information handling, transactions, baggage,  boarding passes, and additional passenger options. The system will provide a user friendly  interface for both administrators and users, ensuring a smooth and efficient operations for the airline.

### Objectives:
•	Develop a robust and user-friendly interface for managing airline operations.  
•	Design a GUI for flight scheduling, and passenger handling.  
•	Ensure data integrity and security by implementing proper authentication and authorization mechanisms.  
•	Provide booking confirmations and other relevant information at time of booking.  
•	Optimize system performance to handle a large volume of transactions efficiently.  
•	Facilitate easy integration with other systems such as payments, option selections, and meal selections.

### Week 5: 
This week, our team achieved a significant milestone with our graphical user interface (GUI), successfully implementing seamless navigation across different pages. We are diligently testing the input functionalities to ensure robust error handling, as demonstrated in the video where the system correctly identifies dates that are not set before the current date.

We are now developing the final page of our GUI, which will feature a confirmation page. This page will display all pertinent details before allowing users to finalize their booking with a "Book" button.

In the upcoming week, our focus will be on ensuring that traveler information is accurately stored and retrieved. We will also start making graphic design enhancements to enhance user experience. Additionally, we plan to begin committing our code and conducting necessary refactoring to improve code quality and maintainability
